## Input / Output

<!-- Populated by /create-agent from the Interaction Model section of AGENT_PLAN.md -->

## Configuration

Agent behavior is controlled by `agent.yaml`. All values support
`${VAR:-default}` environment variable substitution so that the configuration
structure stays baked into the container image while environment-specific
values come from OpenShift ConfigMaps and Secrets at deploy time.

See `agent.yaml` for the full schema.

## Dependencies

The agent requires an LLM endpoint that speaks the OpenAI-compatible chat
completions API. The template uses the OpenAI async SDK, which connects to
vLLM, LlamaStack, llm-d, or any other OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The agent has no dependency on LangChain, LangGraph, or any agent framework.

## Deployment

```sh
make build   # Build the container image
make deploy  # Deploy to OpenShift via Helm
```

See `Makefile` and `chart/` for details.

## Development

This agent was scaffolded using the `agent-loop` template via the `fips-agents`
CLI. The slash command workflow in `.claude/commands/` guides development:

```
/plan-agent   -> design the agent
/create-agent -> scaffold from the plan
/add-tool     -> add a new tool
/add-skill    -> add a new skill
/exercise-agent -> test agent behavior
/deploy-agent -> build and deploy to OpenShift
```
